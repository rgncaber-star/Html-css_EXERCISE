                <h3><h1>Growth and Yield Performance of Different Cassava Cultivars (Manihot esculents) Growth Under Barangay Gadgaran, Calbayog City Condition</h1>
             <hr>
            <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
             <h2>Nature and Importance of the study</h2>
  
            <p>Cassava, Manahot esculenta Crantz, is a perenial woody shrub with an edible root, which grows in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. it is also called yuca, manioc, mandioca and also known kamoteng kahoy or bilanghoy in local name. Cassava is the basis of many products, including food. it is mostly used for human consumption, and also used commercialy for the production of animal feed and starch-based products (IITA, 2009).</p>
       
        <br>
        <br>The cassava industry in the Philippines is now gaining momentum with the existence of various market opportunities. Cassava is grown not only for human food, but also for starch animal feed and industrial uses, For past twenty years cassava production in the Philippines showed an irregular trend. In the late 1070s cassava production was at its peak. There was an increase of 108% area from 87,420 hectare in 1973 to 181, 770 hectare in 1978, which result in a 356% increase in total volume of production and a 120% increase in a average yeild (FAOST, 2001). The increase in the national average cassava yeild 6.38 tons\ha. (Evangelio, 1998)
      
        <br>
        <br> The Bureau of Agricultural Statistics (BAS) selected root crops such as cassava, sweet potato, gabi and ubi registered a total productionof 16,073 metrics tons. Cssava represents 45.36% of the total production with an average yeild of 1.27 metric tons\hectares (http://smar.lgu-ph.com/econo.htm) (82000).

        <br>
        <br>  In local scene, Samar in particular is an agricultural area. but not almost of the population is involve in cassava farming. The researchers hence conduct this study toprivide a sufficient knowledge on the growth under local condition. However, this study was conducted to evaluate the performance of different cassava cultivars at local condition, Samar. The Researcher wanted to improve the yeild performance of the cassava farming especially in local condition.

       <h2>Objective of the study</h2>
       <br>1. To determine the growth and yeild performance of different cassava cultivars.
       <br>2. To determine which cassava variety produce high yeild.

       <h2>Time and Place of the Study</h2>
       <br> The study was conducted from April until December 2009 in the upland area located at Brgy. Geraga-an. Calbayog City, SAMAR.

       <h2>Scoop and Limitation of the Study</h2>
       <br> This research focused on the growth and yield performance of different cassava cultivars such as, T1 (Makan-1), T2 (rayong-5), T3 (Lakan-1), and T4 (Lakan-2) growth under Brgy. Geraga-an Calbayog City, Samar.</h3>

                <h3>MY REFLECTION</h3>
                <p> Through this exercise, I gained a deeper understanding of how important proper HTML structure is, especially when working with headings and paragraphs. By converting Chapter 1 of a thesis or dissertation into an HTML format, I learned how headings create hierarchy and guide the reader, while paragraphs help present information clearly and neatly. Working with an actual academic document made me appreciate how HTML can transform formal research into a clean and accessible web page. The process of preparing the PDF copy, screenshot, and index.html also taught me the value of accuracy and attention to detail. Overall, this activity strengthened my basic HTML skills and increased my confidence in organizing and formatting structured content for the web.</p>
